      I'm Matt Lopez, a Technical Account Manager based in Los Angeles. I have over 5 years of experience in digital media advertising specializing in ad operations.
      I also like to type nonsense in order to get this to look more like a paragraph. I can actually type pretty fast believe it or not. Do you know how fast I can type?
      Like, very fast. By the way, I wonder where the idea of mermaids came from, they're kind of creepy if you think about it, and, how do they go to the bathroom?
